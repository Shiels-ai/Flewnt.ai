## Why a Blog?

We're launching this space to document experiments around AI‑first UX, share lessons from client work, and highlight open source drops. Expect architects notes, design explorations, and some occasional rants about ergonomics in AI tooling.

## What to Expect

- Deep dives into the reasoning systems behind Flewnt
- Case studies from live deployments
- Practical takes on workflow automation and LLM safety

## Stay Tuned

This post is just to make sure the plumbing works. Drop additional markdown files into `src/content/posts` and they'll appear automatically on the blog index thanks to the new static loader. Happy shipping!
